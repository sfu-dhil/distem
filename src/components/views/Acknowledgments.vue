        First, we would like to acknowledge the land on which we live and work.
        SFU is located on the unceded territories of the Coast Salish peoples, including the Musqueam, Squamish, Tsleil-Waututh, and Kwikwetlem Nations.
        Given that the DISTEM Website is a living archive, we welcome feedback and contributions from all local communities.
      </p>
      <p>
        We extend our heartfelt gratitude to <a href="https://www.lib.sfu.ca/users/ashley-edwards" target="_blank">Ashley Edwards</a> (Red River MÃ©tis-settler), SFU's Indigenous Initiatives and Instruction Librarian, for her invaluable contributions to this project.
        Her insights and guidance have been instrumental in helping us understand the profound impact of classification systems on how knowledge and information about Indigenous communities and their ways of knowing and being are perceived, sought out, and utilized.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also express our deep appreciation to <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/dialogue/people/fellows/lindsay-heller.html" target="_blank">Lindsay Heller</a> (Nehiyaw; Michel First Nation), Fellow in Indigenous Ways of Knowing with SFU's Morris J. Wosk Centre for Dialogue, for reviewing our ideas and work, and for sharing valuable feedback that has significantly informed and enriched our efforts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you to the SFU's <a href="https://www.lib.sfu.ca/help/publish/dh/dhil" target="_blank">Digital Humanities Innovation Lab</a> (DHIL) team for bringing our ideas for this website to life.
        We are especially grateful for your patience in working with our ever-changing understanding of how to operationalize decolonization, both in STEM and beyond.
        Thank you for all your support and collaboration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, we'd like to thank SFU's Aboriginal Strategic Initiative (ASI), Transforming Inquiry into Learning and Teaching (TILT), and Faculty of Science for their support and funding.
