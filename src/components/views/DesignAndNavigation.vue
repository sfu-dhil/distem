        The DISTEM Website is a living archive of academic and non-academic resources related to the decolonization and Indigenization of STEM.
        We have organized our collection following <a href="https://www.lib.sfu.ca/users/ashley-edwards" target="_blank">Ashley Edward's</a> (Red River MÃ©tis-settler) <a href="https://www.lib.sfu.ca/help/academic-integrity/indigenous-initiatives/icrc/brian-deer-classification" target="_blank">Indigenous Curriculum Resource Centre Classification: A Locally Modified Brian Deer Classification System</a>, albeit it with additional modifications related to STEM.
      </p>
      <p>
        To understand the importance of such systems in the decolonization of library classification, it is essential to explore Ashley's work with the <a href="https://www.lib.sfu.ca/help/academic-integrity/indigenous-initiatives/icrc" target="_blank">Indigenous Curriculum Resource Centre</a> (ICRC) and her adaptation of the <a href="https://www.lib.sfu.ca/help/academic-integrity/indigenous-initiatives/icrc/brian-deer-classification" target="_blank">Brian Deer Classification System</a> (BDCS).
        Most importantly, classification and categorization systems need to shift away from Western-European knowledge systems to prioritizing Indigenous ways of knowing and being, which are community focused.
        For example, a shift in language from "Indigenous Peoples - History and Culture" to "Indigenous Peoples - Communities," moves the narrative away from historicizing Indigenous peoples toward their power, knowledge, and contemporary contributions.
        Not only does this shift place Indigenous Peoples and communities at the centre, but all other surrounding categories move outward to reflect their relationality to these communities and Indigenous knowledge.
        Such shifts in thinking and doing are crucial for STEM faculty and students to learn and apply.
        We strongly encourage you to follow the links provided above to gain a deeper understanding of these vital concepts and how we can all further <a href="https://www.lib.sfu.ca/help/academic-integrity/indigenous-initiatives/icrc/decolonize-minds" target="_blank">decolonize our minds</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is important to note that the DISTEM website was <u>not</u> designed as a quick stop for Indigenous resource gathering and knowledge extraction, but rather as a tool to help STEM faculty and students begin to decolonize their own minds and practice <u>before</u> trying to integrate Indigenous ways of knowing and being, including via the resources provided here, into their research and/or teaching.
        That is, we strongly encourage all users, whether they are beginning or furthering their decolonial journeys, to commit to: 1) acquiring a deep understanding of what decolonization and Indigenization actually entail; 2) unlearning and then relearning the history and contemporary realities of the lands they inhabit;  3) treating Indigenous ways of knowing and being with deep respect and responsibility; 4) demonstrating reciprocity for the gifts that Indigenous communities, both locally and globally, have shared with us.
        Moving forward without an understanding of these principles can harm Indigenous faculty, students, staff, and communities regardless of one's good intentions.
      </p>

        Finally, we urge you to explore the wide array of resources currently available and beyond your immediate research interests and/or teaching areas.
        These resources are intricately connected and can be adapted to various aspects of your life and work.
        Please note that this is a living document, continually updated to address gaps in research by Indigenous authors and/or about Indigenous knowledge.
        However, these gaps also highlight the need for addition and ongoing scholarship and community work in these areas.
