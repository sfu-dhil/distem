        The Decolonizing and Indigenizing STEM (DISTEM) at SFU project originally began as one component of Dr. Nawal Musleh-Motut's postdoctoral research, which highlighted the dangers and worked to counter the consequences of institutional performances of equity, diversity, and inclusion that support the neocolonial and neoliberal status quo by creating decolonial and just educational futurities via teaching and learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        The overarching goal of the larger DISTEM project was to support STEM faulty as they began or continued to decolonize and Indigenize their pedagogy, curricula, and classrooms at SFU, for both Indigenous and non-Indigenous students.
        This entailed investigating faculty members' understanding of decolonization and Indigenization, assessing their needs and identifying the best tools to assist in operationalizing these processes and goals, and making, implementing, assessing recommendations made by the DISTEM Team.

        One of the major concerns faculty shared was that they lack the time and resources necessary to learn about and then implement these processes, both personally and professionally.
        This issue was exasperated because information and resources related to decolonizing and Indigenizing STEM, as well as teaching and learning, are dispersed and disconnected both online and off, which can be overwhelming for faculty, particularly those just beginning their decolonizing journeys.
        Thus, the DISTEM Website originally aimed to meet faculty needs by creating a central online living archive of relevant and varied resources focused on decolonizing and Indigenizing STEM, both generally and regarding teaching and learning, in postsecondary institutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        From November 2021 to August 2024, the DISTEM Team worked diligently on the larger DISTEM project, as well as this website.
        However, we encountered the same barriers that many decolonial projects face, both within and outside the university, a lack of adequate and sustained commitment, support, and funding.
        These significant challenges not only impacted the realization of the DISTEM Team's larger vision for this website, but also our desire for sustained, collaborative, and responsible efforts to decolonize and Indigenize STEM at SFU.
