        <strong>Edward Anderson</strong> (he, him) is an Ojibwe student who has spent the last two years working on decolonizing and Indigenizing STEM at Simon Fraser University.
        He holds an MSc in Ecological Restoration from Simon Fraser University and the British Columbia Institute of Technology, where he modeled tidal marsh channel development in the context of sea-level rise.
        Edward's primary interests lie in hydrology, environmental information technology, and data management.
        Originally from the United States, he returned to Canada, where his family once fled, viewing this journey as part of his own decolonization process.
        With a background of studying abroad, Edward approached this opportunity as a way to advance his academic, professional, and personal goals.
        Through this experience, he has grappled with the complexities of decolonization, learning that while the concept was familiar, engaging in it with intentional direction revealed just how challenging and multifaceted the process can be.

        <strong>blake danis</strong> (they, them) is a 4th generation white settler with French and Eastern European heritage and identifies as a queer non-binary PhD candidate in biology.
        Their research focuses on the effects of contaminants on amphibians within the field of ecotoxicology, which is inherently intersectional, addressing environmental justice, food sovereignty, land and peoples' rights, animal welfare, and policy connections.
        Their lived experiences in low socioeconomic conditions and directly facing the challenges as well as observing the struggles of others in low-income housing, especially with physical and mental health challenges, have fueled their strong sense of justice.
        Being part of the dominant academic system, they noticed many perspectives were overlooked in their education, particularly Indigenous worldsenses, which should be foundational in undergraduate science programs.

        <strong>Megan Donahue</strong> (she, her) is mixed British settler and Cree on her mother's side and French settler and St’át’imc Nation on her father's side, as well as a member of Xwisten (Bridge River) First Nation.
        She holds a Bachelor's degree in Biology with a minor in Chemistry from SFU.
        As a first-generation university graduate, Megan has navigated her identity, growing up off-reserve and gradually connecting with her cultural roots.
        During the pandemic, she deepened her understanding of Indigenous history and its ongoing impact.
        Her journey led her to join efforts in decolonizing and Indigenizing STEM at SFU, where she had the privilege of learning and contributing alongside a team that expanded her knowledge far beyond what she could have gained through books or online resources.

        <strong>Haley Montgomery</strong> (she/her) grew up in the U.S. with roots in Scotland and Fort Qu’Appelle, Saskatchewan.
        Influenced by her family, she developed a worldview that challenges Western knowledge, a perspective that informs her research, connections, and education.
        She holds a Master of Public Health from SFU, completed in 2022, with a specialization in epidemiology and health promotion.

        <strong>Nawal Musleh-Motut, PhD.</strong> (she, her) is a settler of Palestinian descent and was the Postdoctoral Fellow in Social Justice and Decolonization with SFU's <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/teaching-inquiry.html" target="_blank">Transforming Inquiry into Learning and Teaching</a> (TILT) from September 2021 to August 2024.
        Her postdoctoral research highlighted the dangers and worked to counter the consequences of institutional performances of equity, diversity, and inclusion that support the neocolonial and neoliberal status quo by creating decolonial and just educational futurities via teaching and learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her primary research, writing, and teaching interests include: decolonial theory and praxis; critical intersectional social justice; critical race/anti-racism theory and praxis; critical, imaginative, and performative ethnography; visual culture; narrative and storytelling; solidarity and the creation of decolonial futurities between Indigenous, Palestinian, and Black communities globally.
